			<h1 id="introduction">After a long journey beset by hardships, your destination finally stands in front of you: the Tomb of the Four Kings.
				None now remain who can retell their trials, their victories, or even their names. But one legend persists across time. Each king 
				kept secret a vast store of treasures; their covetousness exceeding even their mortal bounds, they demanded to be buried with them.
				<br>
				And here you stand, before the ruins and final remnant of their reign... Who knows how deep the delve will take to recover their treasure...
				And who knows what manner of creatures and arcane traps might have brought an end to travellers before you... You have only your nerve and
				four torches to guide you. 
				<br>
				Will you brave the depths below?
